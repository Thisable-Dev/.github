The first all-in-one accessibility app in Indonesia for all types of disability.

We are providing this application to all Indonesian people, especially people with disabilities. To prepare this app for the visually impaired, we have optimized our app by taking the advantage of the Talkback feature.

With the rapid development of technology, if we ignore their needs, there will be many people who cannot adapt and suffer. We believe that technology exists to help them.

According to the World Health Organization in 2019, 1 out of 10 people in Indonesia is a person with a disability. But it's not just people with disabilities who need this  easy accessibility. We all need it. Let's see this:

![Based on World Health Organization research in 2019](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57006944/173194913-779af425-dd23-46f0-a3c4-b6fff03f9595.png)

From these problems it can be concluded that we all need convenience to communicate with disabled friends. The country, government, organizations, families, and the surrounding environment have a responsibility to facilitate communication and the lives of people with disabilities.
